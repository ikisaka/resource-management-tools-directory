2. https://www.float.com/
3. https://www.runn.io/
4. https://www.forecastapp.com/
5. https://www.forecast.app/ - nope, this is not the same as above. It is completely different platform.

7. https://www.tempo.io/
8. https://resourceguruapp.com/
9. https://www.teamgantt.com/
10. https://www.hellobonsai.com/
11. https://www.bigtime.net/ - Pretty complext platform, sometime I get lost with so many features, but I am pretty sure that it is a solid tool for managing projects. Even though, I would definitely remove some vanity features.
12. https://linear.app/ - looks like they have close cooperation with openAI
13. https://www.epicflow.com/ - I can't even believe, that anyone is using this tool. Their pricing is crazy, they charge 25€ per person/month.
14. https://teamhood.com/ - Looks pretty solid. I will check out their free plan a little bit later and i will update this info.

## Resource planning tools for construction sites
1. https://www.outbuild.com/
2. https://www.procore.com/
3. https://www.hcss.com/
4. https://www.ganttic.com/
5. https://www.procore.com/ - Hard to evaluate. They don't have freemium version or public demo, nor transparent pricing. You have to request demo call and pricing indicidually. This is not a fair approach nowdays. On the other hand, based on landing page, this looks like complex management tool that will probably cover a low of needs of construction site.
